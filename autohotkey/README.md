## Autohotkey scripts

Scripts to make my life easier.

Win+7 to launch Resolume composition
Win+8 to launch TouchDesigner tox
Win+9 to launch beat-link-trigger

Run these all in sequence when the script runs.

Run the script when Windows starts up by adding a shortcut to the .ahk file, to the Startup folder in the Start menu. Try Win+R and run `shell:Startup` to get there.
